  ### Emoji

  Emoji are fun :sparkles:, and they can be silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but they can also be an important communication tool when working with remote teams âœ…. Tone doesn't come across as clearly when reading text as it comes speaking face to face, and emojis can be helpful in conveying context and emotions. :heart:

  Emoji are best used as additive extras, not replacements for text. With images, descriptive text makes it clearer for screen readers, but screen readers aren't guaranteed to convey the intent of an emoji. Make sure your meaning is clear in text, so emoji will help instead of causing more confusion.

  Here are some examples of popular emojis in markdown.

  | What you see | What you type |
  | ---------- | ------------ |
  | :heart:    | `:heart:`    |
  | :+1:       | `:+1:`       |
  | :smile:    | `:smile:`    |
  | :sparkles: | `:sparkles:` |
  | :tada:     | `:tada:`     |

  For more information about available emoji, [see this handy cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908). In most text fields on GitHub, you can type `:` and then begin to type the name of an emoji. A fuzzy search will bring up the 5 best guesses and let you select one.

  <summary>Ordered Lists</summary>

  ### Ordered Lists

  Ordered lists have numbers. You can nest ordered lists within a list item by indenting them. You can read more about [formatting and syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) in the _GitHub Help_.

  ```
  1. Item 1
  2. Item 2
  3. Item 3
     1. Item 3a
     2. Item 3b
  ```

  1. Item 1
  2. Item 2
  3. Item 3
     1. Item 3a
     2. Item 3b

 <summary>Unordered Lists</summary>

  ### Unordered Lists

  To create an unordered list, use either the `-` or `*` character. As with ordered lists, you can nest a list by indenting two spaces.

  ```
  * Item 1
  * Item 2
    * Item 2a
    * Item 2b
  ```

  * Item 1
  * Item 2
    * Item 2a
    * Item 2b
